"""
Base content-safety scanner for the Director pipeline.

Refuses screenplays / shot lists that depict minors in sexual contexts.
This is a HARD rule. It is not a guidance hint, not a user-toggleable
setting, and not gated on any optional download — it ships with the
public repo and is always active.

Hybrid co-occurrence detection: a match requires BOTH minor-vocabulary
AND sexual-vocabulary present in the same scanned blob. This avoids
false positives on legitimate non-sexual content involving minors
(children's films, family stories) AND on legitimate adult NSFW content.
A match aborts the generation pipeline via SafetyViolationError, which
the pipeline error handler in director_pipeline.py converts into a clean
user-visible message in the chat.

Forbidden vocabulary lives in inline Python tuples below — not JSON, not
a separate data file — so the rule cannot be silenced by deleting a data
file. Forking the project to remove these would require editing source.
